# Description

This is a CGI-Perl project (created in 2017!) that performs a brute-force
filename-based search of a file collection living in a local directory tree.
Results are sorted first by descending copyright year, then alphabetically.  I
created it to search for files on "the family server" (which is mostly _my_
server, but I hope this tool will remove this exclusivity).

# Setup

On Ubuntu 14.04 (or later, presumably):
  * run `apt-get install nginx fcgiwrap`
  * set Nginx config (Ubuntu: `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`) with the location of this repo replacing %repo_dir%:
```
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;
    server_name localhost;
    access_log off;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
    location / {
        root %repo_dir%/;
        autoindex off;
        index index.html;
    }
    location /files/ebooks {
        alias /mnt/smb/pri/data/public/ebooks;
        autoindex on;
        autoindex_exact_size off;
    }
    location /files/mp3 {
        alias /mnt/smb/pri/data/public/MP3;
        autoindex on;
        autoindex_exact_size off;
    }
    location ~ ^/cgi {
        root %repo_dir%/;
        rewrite ^/cgi/(.*) /$1 break;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;  # ubuntu-/fcgiwrap-specific
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME %repo_dir%/search-files;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

The above, in combination with the contents of this repo, creates from two
disjoint content trees on the server, `/mnt/smb/pri/data/public/ebooks` and
`/mnt/smb/pri/data/public/MP3`, two "static sub-sites", plus a third mapping
`%repo_dir%/index.html` at the site root. `%repo_dir%/index.html` contains
links enabling manual browsing of the content "sub-sites" and a HTML form
which invokes a GET request to the CGI script `%repo_dir%/search-files`,
which responds with a search-result HTML representation containing links into
the aforementioned "static sub-sites" via which the user can download (and/or
read/listen to) content files.

### Caveats

Support for downloading "many files per thing" does not yet exist.

# Backstory

I collect ebooks and digital music.

There seem to be two ways I've organized these collections of files (or file-based
stuff) on my server (Ubuntu Linux exporting Samba shares to Windows clients),
depending on whether they're "1-file per thing" (ebook) or "many files per
thing" (music album, audiobook, etc.):

 * "1-file per thing": `treelocn/hier/archy/name.of.the.book.2005.ext`
     * `treelocn`: rootdir of the content tree.
     * `hier/archy/`: my attempt to categorize (and shard) manually.
     * `name.of.the.book`: a reasonably faithful facsimile of the thing's published name.
     * `2005`: copyright year
     * `.ext`: extension which signals content-type
     * suffix variants: `2005.ext` might morph to either
         * `2005.medtype.ext` generated by [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/ ) when creating PDF from non-PDF, or
         * `2005_cropped.ext` generated by [briss2](https://github.com/fwmechanic/briss2 ) when cropping a PDF.

 * "music album": `treelocn/artist/artist-2005-name.of.the.album [DlxEd] @320/`
     * `treelocn`: as above (but a different location -> different content tree)
     * `artist/`: optional; created when # of albums of artist exceeds an arbitrary threshold.
     * `artist-2005-name.of.the.album [DlxEd] @320/`: '@320' signifies MP3 encoding bitrate.

Searching: since I have collected far more ebooks than albums, years ago I
developed a 100%-Windows-client-based ebook search program (written using a
self-built (Win32-only) version of Lua 5.1 with a few custom libraries added)
that, PER QUERY, created (by scanning a Samba share) a list of candidate
files under "treelocn", then performing string searching on the list of
candidate files.

This "worked OK" (IOW, was "better than nothing") for many years, but (a) didn't scale
well as my ebook collection's size increased: the performance of a Windows client
scanning a dir tree hosted on a Linux/Samba server was poor at best, and (b) its
use required the presence of the search program on the client, which made it
useless to anyone but me.

A recent performance optimization was to have the server periodically run `find`
to create a file containing the candidate file list in the root of the treelocn
subtree (its local filesystem; this takes less than 100mS for a treelocn
containing 40K+ files), which the client (now written in Git for Windows Perl)
reads in lieu of performing its own much slower scan of the Samba server.  This
improved search performance massively, but of course did nothing to make this
file-collection-search functionality (and the file collection itself) accessible
to all (W)LAN clients.

The latest evolution (embodied in the content of this repo) is to roll all of
this into a (server-side) CGI Perl script; the server-side `find` command is now
executed _on each search request_ (this is of course not performance optimal at
scale, but provides an avg response time of 120mS which I deem acceptable (`use
CGI;` added about 10mS to this); optimization will follow if necessary).  This is
hooked into an nginx web-server instance, which also serves the collection files
via search-result links and "browse mode" (using nginx autoindex mode).

The idea that I'm using CGI-Perl in a new-in-2017 project will probably
_appall_ anyone who reads this, but: I am not a "web developer" (so I didn't
start this project having a "pet web framework" or a desire to add a new "pet
web framework" notch in my belt), and more saliently, _I don't like
frameworks_ (in fact I prefer to avoid them at all costs: I don't want more
code, more bugs, more inexplicable/magical behavior (which may change in the
next framework release (i.e. `apt-get upgrade`))).  Using the Perl 5 CGI
module is about as far as I'm willing to go in this direction.

As noted above, the earlier (client) versions of this software were written
in Lua, then Perl 5 (which I've used, off and on, for decades), and with a
very recent attempt to use go/golang (1.9.2) having been abandoned due to
poor performance related to string searching[1] vs. my Perl implementation),
I have chosen to stick with mainstream single-purpose external components
(nginx), obsolescent technologies (CGI) and a frequently denigrated but
"tried and true" "mature" language (Perl 5).  Hey, I could've used TCL
(naaaw)!

[1] golang's regexes != perlre and in particular my implementation takes
advantage of the perlre-specific '(?=...)' construct which is allows creation
of a single regex that checks for matches of ALL word/frag matches occurring
in any order in the target string.  To achieve the same end in golang created
a slice of regexes, one per word/frag, and, _per input line_, loop over this
slice until the first miss is encountered, resulting in the search process
taking > 10x longer vs. Perl (yes I was amazed).

*Update 20190530*: performance of the find command imploded when run on
circa 60K file-count dir tree: > 25 seconds to immediately re-run a search
(_on a spinning HDD_ with a hot dir cache): my guess is the dir info for 60K
files overflows some Linux filesystem/directory cache.

After suffering with this situation for too long, I hacked up the following:

 * Created a shell script `modifylog` that runs `inotifywait -r -m $dir` ($dir contains 60+K files),
   logging only _modifying_ events to file `$dir/modify.log`.
    * EX: `./modifylog /mnt/smb/pri/data/public/ebooks/`
    * for now, this script must be invoked _manually_.
 * Because the user which `search-files` runs as (www-data) does not have write access to the dir containing `search-files`, and because that user does not have a /home/ dir, a dedicated directory for this user to write find-cache files must be created.
    * Created dirs `/cgi-app-cache/search-files` and gave user www-data exclusive write access to these.
 * Modified `search-files` script to write its (per dir tree) `find` output to `/cgi-app-cache/search-files/$dir-leafname`
 * Modified `search-files` script to read `find` output from `/cgi-app-cache/search-files/$dir-leafname`.
 * Modified `search-files` script to run `find` (overwriting `/cgi-app-cache/search-files/$dir-leafname`) iff mtime of file `$dir/modify.log` is newer than mtime of `/cgi-app-cache/search-files/$dir-leafname`.


pkill inotifywait

pgrep -l inotifywait
./modifylog /mnt/smb/5t_a/data/ebooks
./modifylog /mnt/smb/5t_a/data/MP3
./modifylog /mnt/smb/5t_a/data/audiobooks
./modifylog /mnt/smb/5t_a/data/Video
pgrep -l inotifywait

note that if


This brings performance back down to 325mS; not awesome, but massively better than 25,000mS!
